# Ethnicity and Highschool Scores

- Which ethnicity is represented the most and which is represented the least?
- Do the different ethnicities and genders perform differently?
- Which gender/ethnicity has the best performance and which has the worst in the different subjects?
- Can we find a combination which is always better?
  - If yes, which one?
  - If no, then what about overall performance?
