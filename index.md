  - why is the task being performed (action/target combos)
  - how is the vis idiom constructed in terms of design choices (encode, manipulate, facet, reduce)
- An explanation of the interaction design including the controls to illustrate at least each interaction design concept once (signifier, affordance, system state, feedback, feedforward)
- Discussion of the design (strengths/weaknesses) with at least two other visual designs explored and visually documented in the report
- The interaction needs to include at least two plots that are linked
- A description of the evaluation of the design with at least one participant explaining to what degree they were able to use the interface and answer the questions you set out to answer. 
- A section discussing ethical concerns of the chosen visualization and interactions
